Table:
Arrows:+++-(most logical, smooth)(empty field => you do not know what to do at first)
Drag Circle: ++---(easily understandable, reminds of swipe screen on iphone))(focus on circle easily lost)
Three Dots:++---(does not make sense; easy to miss, too slow; too much accuracy needed)
Timer: -+(simple to use, easy to abort)
Hand:
Arrows:
Drag Circle: -----+(Dragging too difficult)
Three Dots:+--
Timer: ++++++-(easiest because static; hand and eye movement difficult=>static solution better)(too small)

Could you imagine playing card game?
+++++--- (fascinating technology;(interesting / special); cards alone boring (card games in reality boring))(hand tracking too bad; generally not interested in card games)
